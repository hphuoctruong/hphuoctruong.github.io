<p>Recall that for every measure \(\mu\) on a Banach space $X$ and \(f:X \to Y\) is measure the push-forward measure</p>

<p><strong>Definition.</strong> A Borel measure on \(E\) is said to be a Gaussian measure if for every continuous linear functional \(f: E \to \mathbb{R}\), the push-forward measure \(f_* \mu\) is a Gaussian measure on \(\mathbb{R}.\)</p>
