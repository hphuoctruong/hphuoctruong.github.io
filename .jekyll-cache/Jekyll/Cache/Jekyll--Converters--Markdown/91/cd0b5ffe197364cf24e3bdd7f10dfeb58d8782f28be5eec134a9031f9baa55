<h2 id="gaussian-measure">Gaussian measure.</h2>

<p>Recall that for every measure \(\mu\) on \(E\) and \(f:E \to F\) is measurable, the push-forward measure \(f_* \mu\) is defined as
\(f_*\mu (B) = \mu \left(\{ x \in E: f(x) \in B \} \right),\quad \forall B \in \mathbb{B}(F).\)</p>

<p><strong>Definition (Gaussian measure).</strong> A Borel measure on \(E\) is said to be a Gaussian measure if for every continuous linear functional \(f: E \to \mathbb{R}\), the push-forward measure \(f_* \mu\) is a Gaussian measure on \(\mathbb{R}.\)</p>
