A **probability space** is a triplet $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})$ , where $\Omega$ is the sample space, $\mathcal{F}$ is a $$\sigma-$$algebra of events and $$\mathbb{P}$$ is a probability measure on $$\Omega$$.

Let $$(X,\mathbb{B}(X))$$ be a measurable space, where $$\mathbb{B}(X)$$ denotes the Borel $$\sigma-$$algebra generated by the open sets of $$X$$.

A measurable mapping $$f: \Omega \to X$$ is a random variable. This random variable induces a probability measure $$\mu$$ on $$X$$ given by

$$\mu(E):= \mathbb{P}(f^{-1}(E)) = \mathbb{P}\left(\left\{\omega \in \Omega: f(\omega) \in E\right\}\right),\quad E \in \mathbb{B}(X).$$

(The measure $$\mu$$ is also called the push-forward of $$\mathbb{P}$$ via $$f$$ and is denoted by $$f_*\mu$$.)
