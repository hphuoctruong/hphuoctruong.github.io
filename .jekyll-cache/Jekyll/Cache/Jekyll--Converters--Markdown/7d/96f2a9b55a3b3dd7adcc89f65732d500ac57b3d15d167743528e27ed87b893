<p>A <strong>probability space</strong> is a triplet \((\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})\), where \(\Omega\) is the sample space, \(\mathcal{F}\) is a \(\sigma-\) algebra of events and \(\mathbb{P}\) is a probability measure on \(\Omega\).</p>

<p>Let \((X,\mathbb{B}(X))\) be a measurable space, where \(\mathbb{B}(X)\) denotes the Borel \(\sigma-\) algebra generated by the open sets of \(X\).</p>

<p>A measurable mapping \(u: \Omega \to X\) is a random variable. This random variable induces a probability measure \(\mu\) on \(X\) given by</p>

\[\mu(E):= \mathbb{P}(u^{-1}(E)) = \mathbb{P}\left(\left\{\omega \in \Omega: f(\omega) \in E\right\}\right),\quad E \in \mathbb{B}(X).\]

<p>In this case, the measure \(\mu\) is called the <strong>probability distribution</strong> of \(u\) and we write \(u \sim \mu\).</p>

<p>(We note that \(\mu\) is also called the push-forward of \(\mathbb{P}\) via \(f\) and is denoted by \(f_*\mu\).)</p>

<p>Let $u,y: \Omega \to X$ be two random variables.</p>
