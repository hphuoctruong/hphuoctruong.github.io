<p>A <strong>probability space</strong> is a triplet \((\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})\), where \(\Omega\) is the sample space, \(\mathcal{F}\) is a \(\sigma-\) algebra of events and \(\mathbb{P}\) is a probability measure on \(\Omega\).</p>

<p>Let \((E,\mathbb{B}(E))\) be a measurable space, where \(\mathbb{B}(E)\) denotes the Borel \(\sigma-\) algebra generated by the open sets of \(E\).</p>

<p>A measurable mapping \(u: \Omega \to E\) is a random variable. This random variable induces a probability measure \(\mu\) on \(E\) given by</p>

<p>[\mu(A):= \mathbb{P}(u^{-1}(A)) = \mathbb{P}\left(\left{\omega \in \Omega: u(\omega) \in A\right}\right),\quad A \in \mathbb{B}(E).]</p>

<p>In this case, the measure \(\mu\) is called the <strong>probability distribution</strong> of \(u\) and we write \(u \sim \mu\).</p>

<p>In this note, we use the notations \(X,Y, u, y, \ldots\) to denote random variables.</p>

<p>(We note that \(\mu\) is also called the push-forward of \(\mathbb{P}\) via \(u\) and is denoted by \(u_*\mathbb{P}\).)</p>

<p>Let \((\Omega_1, \mathcal{F}_1)\) and \((\Omega_2,\mathcal{F}_2)\) be measurable spaces and let \(\mu\) be a measure on \((\Omega_1, \mathcal{F}_1)\). Let</p>

<p>If \(X\) is a random variable on \((\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})\), then</p>

<p>[\int f(x) \mathbb{P}(X \in dx):= \int f(x) dX_*\mathbb{P}(x) = \int_]</p>

<h2 id="conditional-probability-and-conditional-distribution"><strong>Conditional probability and conditional distribution</strong></h2>

<p>Let \(u,y: \Omega \to X\) be two random variables. We first consider a simple case where \(X = \mathbb{R}^n\). The conditional probability distribution of \(Y\) given \(X\) is a Markov kernel</p>
